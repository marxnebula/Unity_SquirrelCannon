# Squirrel Cannon Game
2D Android/iOS game made using Unity3D with C#.
STILL IN PROGRESS

The User touches the screen to shoot the squirrel out of a log cannon and into the next.
The goal is to reach the end of the level while collecting nuts on the way.
Specific log cannons move, rotate, or automatically shoot!
